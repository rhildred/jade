# JAvascript based Database Editor
*A web based GUI client for SQLite.*
Get it on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jade/bponbdjkefbmgkfiiphhabghkkfocook) or [try online demo](https://rhildred.github.io/jade/).

I needed this for a Database class with the text Kroenke, D. M. & Auer, D. J., (2015), Database Concepts,8th Ed. Formerly students used MS Access in the lab. Jade is a browser solution for students not having MS Access on their machines at home.

----------

## Development

**Web UI**
To see the code in action, just start a local server and point it the code directory.

**Chrome Plugin**

 1. go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) in chrome
 2. enable developer mode
 3. select `load unpacked extension...` and select the project directory

### Publishing
To generate a compressed code run

```
make web_ui
make extension
```
